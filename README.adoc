= Pause and Resume at SCSt Source

This sample demonstrates the use of Jolokia to pause and resume a Spring Cloud Stream `Source` application.
Since we wouldn't know what's producing the messages, it is hard to control it. However, if `@Poller` is used
in the Source, we could resolve the bean and invoke it's `start` or `stop` definitions to control its operation.
